# FAT16-recovery

Honor code: â€œNo member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community." Therefore, if you are taking or plan on taking CS24, do not look over these files.

For my CS24 (Intro to Computing Systems) class at Caltech, I implemented this code to recover deleted files from the FAT-16 file-handler system.
